#  ML Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects Portfolio**! This repository showcases my hands-on work in various ML domains like computer vision, healthcare, and salary prediction. Each project is built using real-world datasets, Jupyter Notebooks, and techniques like classification, regression, and CNNs.

## Projects Included

###  Rice Leaf Disease Detection using CNN
- **Type**: Image Classification (Computer Vision)
- **Tools**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, CNN
- **Overview**: Identifies rice leaf diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Helps farmers take action at the right time by automating disease recognition.
- **Notebook**: [`Rice Leaf Disease using CNN.ipynb`](./Rice%20Leaf%20Disease%20using%20CNN.ipynb)

### Texas Employee Salary Prediction
- **Type**: Regression
- **Tools**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Linear Regression, Random Forest
- **Overview**: Predicts employee salaries using historical salary data and job features from Texas public service records.
- **Notebook**: [`PRCP - 1024 Texas Employee Salary Prediction.ipynb`](./PRCP%20-%201024%20Texas%20Employee%20Salary%20Prediction.ipynb)
